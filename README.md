# Inspector
Project targeting Android, iOS and Web using C/C++, Java, Objective-C, Vue.js, WebSocket, SQLite and IndexedDB.
The main goal of this tool is to inspect the SQLite databases and intercept network requests from mobile applications.
The data is shown in a web interface and uses WebSocket to communicate directly with the app via local network.
To keep network log history the web system uses the built-in IndexedDB from the browser.
